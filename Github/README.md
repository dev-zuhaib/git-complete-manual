Templates help standardize issues and PRs:

1. Create `.github` directory in your repository
2. Add template files:
   - `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`
   - `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`
   - `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`

Example bug report template:
```markdown
---
name: Bug Report
about: Create a report to help us improve
title: '[BUG] '
labels: 'bug'
assignees: ''
---

**Describe the bug**
A clear description of the issue.

 - Browser: [e.g. Chrome 92]
 - Version: [e.g. 2.1.0]
```

### Repository Insights

GitHub provides analytics about your repository:
- **Pulse**: Activity overview
- **Contributors**: Who contributed and how much
- **Community**: Health metrics and recommended practices
- **Traffic**: Views and clones
- **Commits**: Commit history and patterns
- **Code frequency**: Additions and deletions over time
- **Dependency graph**: Package dependencies

## GitHub Flow

GitHub Flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow:

1. **Create a branch** from the repository
2. **Make changes** and add commits
3. **Open a pull request**
4. **Review and discuss** the code
5. **Deploy** for final testing (optional)
6. **Merge** the pull request

### Branching Strategies

**Common Branch Types:**
- `main` or `master`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: New features
- `hotfix/*`: Urgent fixes for production
- `release/*`: Preparing for a release

**Protection Rules:**
1. Go to repository settings â†’ Branches
2. Click "Add rule" next to branch protection rules
3. Configure options like:
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks
   - Require signed commits
   - Include administrators
   - Restrict who can push

## Pull Requests

Pull Requests (PRs) are the heart of collaboration on GitHub.

### Creating a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to GitHub
2. Navigate to your repository
3. Click "Compare & pull request"
4. Fill in the PR title and description
5. Select reviewers, assignees, labels
6. Click "Create pull request"

**Through the CLI (with GitHub CLI):**
```bash
gh pr create --title "Add new feature" --body "This PR implements..." --reviewer username
```

### Anatomy of a Pull Request

2. Add comments on specific lines
3. Suggest changes using the suggestion feature
4. Submit your review with:
   - Comment: General feedback
   - Approve: Ready to merge
   - Request changes: Needs modifications

**Best Practices:**
- Be respectful and constructive
- Review for correctness, style, and performance
- Consider edge cases
- Ask questions instead of making demands
- Use suggestions for minor fixes

### Merging Options

- **Merge commit**: Preserves all commits and creates a merge commit
- **Squash and merge**: Combines all commits into one
- **Rebase and merge**: Applies changes without a merge commit

**Auto-merge:**
